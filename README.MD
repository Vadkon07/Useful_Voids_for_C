# About repository

This repository contains header which will be very useful for your projects. We all do a lot of routine tasks in our apps, as clear screen, wait, etc., and to write all these voids from zero we have to spend really pretty significant amount of time. This file contains a lot of useful voids which can be called in any time.

## Usage

Just add in you code_name.c:

	#include <templates.h> (or with " ")

Then call voids during your project. Simple and useful!

## What motivated me to create this project

I like Python by his simplicity and automation. In Python we can write our codes very fast because literally every thing which you import was already created, and you shouldn't write her from zero as we do it in C.

I will be very happy if you will add inside even more useful templates! You can take them from your codes, codes of others, or even by AI.
